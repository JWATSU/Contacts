# Contacts

This is a project from https://hyperskill.org/. A program that let you create, manage, search and store/load contacts from disk. A contact can be a person or organization and have fields such as name, birthday, creation & last edit date, telephone number and gender. I worked with features such as serialization, regex, inheritance and polymorphism. I also learned about various design patterns. 

There were a few strange things about this project regarding its design that I had to implement. I may fix these as I see fit in the future.

NOTE: The GIF below gives an idea of how the program work, although the UI is a bit different in reality.
