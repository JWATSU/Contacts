# Contacts

NOTE: ONGOING PROJECT.

This is a project from https://hyperskill.org/. A program that let you create, manage, search and store/load contacts from disk. A contact can be a person or organization and have fields such as name, birthday, creation & last edit date, telephone number and gender. I worked with features such as serialization, regex, inheritance and polymorphism. I also learned about various design patterns.
